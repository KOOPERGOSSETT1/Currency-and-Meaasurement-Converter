This is my currency converter that I made in java. This uses Java's GUI and will solve the mathmatical problems automatic when the correct numbers and choices are entered into it's system. 

I choose to make a currency calculator because I alwas wondered what other currencies are work in other curriencies. Most people would most likly search up a currency converter. People love to compare the value of items that are sold in diffrent coutries. With my currency converter the user can convert the currencies of thier choosing and choose the amount they wish to convert.

Many people today do not have the knowledge of the diffrent currency types and how much they are worth. It is a problem that can be solved with this currency converter.

I learned how to make a comprehinsive GUI with text boxes, dropdown boxes, and buttons that  do diffrent things. I think that the hardest part of my project was formating the dropdown boxes and text boxes in the correct spot.
