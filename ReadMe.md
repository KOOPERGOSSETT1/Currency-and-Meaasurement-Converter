This is my measurement converter that I made in java. This uses Java's GUI and will solve the mathmatical problems automaticly when the correct numbers and choices are entered into it's system. 

I choose to make a measurement calculator because it seems very useful for every day use. On my phone I have a currency converter and I thought that I should make one in Java

Many people today do not have the knowledge of the diffrent measurement types and the amount of each equal another measurement. It is a problem that can be solved with this measurement converter.

I learned how to make a comprehinsive GUI with text boxes, dropdown boxes, and buttons that  do diffrent things. I think that the hardest part of my project was formating the dropdown boxes and text boxes in the correct spot.

**How to use the GUI**

1.  Run the java program by clicking "RUN".
2.  Type your name in the java console/output when prompted.
3.  Read the text that pops up after you entered your name.
4.  Choose which measurement you are wanting to convert from.
5.  Choose which measurement you are wanting to convert to.
6.  Type the amount you want to convert.

After you have done these steps the GUI will automaticly convert the measurements.
